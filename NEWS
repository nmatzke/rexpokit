CHANGES in rexpokit VERSION 0.26.6

NEW FEATURES
    
    o None

BUG FIXES

    o None
    
OTHER CHANGES
    
    o In FORTRAN code, fixed one final warning on CRAN precheck Windows/Debian compiler:
      complex(kind=8) alpha(ndeg), theta(ndeg), tmpc ->
      complex(kind=8) alpha(2*ndeg), theta(2*ndeg), tmpc
      ...this avoids issues with array overruns when the legacy code is
         checked on gfortran-8 (alpha and theta were size 7, should be 14)
    o Returning CRAN maintainer to Nick Matzke nickmatzke.ncse@gmail.com

OTHER CHANGES
    
    o In FORTRAN code, edits to comply with on CRAN precheck Windows/Debian compiler
      with "-fpic  -g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -mtune=native -c" flags
    o All changes involved explicitly specifying KIND, or commenting out
      unused code/variables (due to print statements previously commented
      out for previous CRAN compliance)

CHANGES in rexpokit VERSION 0.26

NEW FEATURES
    
    o None

BUG FIXES

   	o Numerous changes were made to FORTRAN source to solve CRAN check
   	  warnings or installation issues on e.g. Windows machines
   	  (https://win-builder.r-project.org). Typically these were obsolescence
      issues with legacy F77 code. Typically the solution was to convert to
      F90 standard. Summary below.
   	o Fix to a CRAN-identified NOTE: "Packages in Depends field not imported from:
	    'Rcpp'  'SparseM' 'methods'."  Solution: removed methods and SparseM from 
	    Depends, moved Rcpp to Imports in NAMESPACE file
    o Commented out -W flag in Makevars, in order to remove "Non-portable 
      flags in variable 'PKG_FFLAGS'" warning
    o Summary of modernization edits to FORTRAN:
    o complex*16 -> complex(kind=8)
    o CHARACTER*6 -> CHARACTER(LEN=6)
    o double complex -> complex(kind=8)
    o absx = dabs(dreal(zx(i))) -> absx = DABS(REALPART(Zx(i)))
    o absx = dabs(dimag(zx(i))) -> absx = DABS(IMAGPART(Zx(i)))
    o Removed all "statement functions", replaced with basic math in-line
    o Variable declarations for dreal, dimag, dzum, dzumi, dzumr now unnecessary and
      commented out
    o Replaced "Computed GO TO" statements loops re-coded using On-Line 
      Fortran F77 - F90 Converter: https://www.fortran.uk/plusfortonline.php
    o Problems like "Index '2' of dimension 1 of array 'dx' above upper bound of 1"
      solved with changing dx(1) -> dx(n), dy(1) -> dy(n)
    o cabs1 "statement function" replaced with several in-line calculations
    o All example matrix exponentiations checked after FORTRAN edits
    o Generated "init.c" using package_native_routine_registration_skeleton() in 
      order to register native routines. 
      (Following instructions at: 
      https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2017-February/073755.html)
    o init.c content was integrated into pre-existing "wrappers.cpp", adding
      "R_CMethodDef CEntries[]" and "R_init_rexpokit" entries


OTHER CHANGES
    
    o Changed Maintainer email (Nicholas J. Matzke, matzke@berkeley.edu -> 
      Nicholas J. Matzke, nickmatzke.ncse@gmail.com); this is a permanent email.
      All functions changed as well.
    o Added maxent function to avoid BioGeoBEARS dependency on FD
    o Minor edits to documentation
    o Made examples not depend on SparseM
    o updated CITATION file to refer to first publication on BioGeoBEARS/rexpokit: 
      Matzke, Nicholas J. (2013). Probabilistic historical biogeography: 
      new models for founder-event speciation, imperfect detection, and fossils allow 
      improved accuracy and model-testing. Frontiers of Biogeography, 5(4), 242-248.

CHANGES in rexpokit VERSION 0.25 (2014-05-17, GitHub version)

NEW FEATURES
    
    o (Drew Schmidt) rewrote compiled code wrappers to improve performance (~10-40%).
    o Fixed Fortran flags.
    o Added demos.

OTHER CHANGES
    
    o Added Drew Schmidt, Univ. Tennessee Knoxville, as a coauthor
    o Minor changes to documentation to avoid links outside of package (to diversitree and expoRkit)
    o Wrote local alternative for as.matrix.coo to remove dependency on SparseM package



CHANGES in rexpokit VERSION 0.24.1

NEW FEATURES

    o removed live links to the ctarma package, which has been archived (ctarma was
      not a dependency, it was just linked from the documentation for explanatory
      purposes)
    o fixed line-length issue in various places in the documentation
    o added NEWS file
