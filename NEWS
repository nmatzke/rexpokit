    o Fixed LTO warning noted here:
      www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/LTO/rexpokit.out
      It was an issue with zswapy:
      input "m" is complex, explicitly converted to 
      integer tempm, tempm=INT(m) to avoid possible change of type. This
      fixes this LTO warning: lapack.f:1261:72: warning: 
      type of 'zswapy' does not match original declaration -Wlto-type-mismatch
      1261 zswapy(tempkm1,tempx,tempzx,1,b(1),1)
      blas_mod.f:961:24: note: 'zswapy' was previously declared here
      961 zswapy (n,m,zx,incx,zy,incy)
      ...which I replicated on Mac OS X Monterey 12.5 with a fresh install of gcc 13.2 
         following these directions at gcc.gnu.org wiki InstallingGCC

BUG FIXES

    o None
    
OTHER CHANGES
    
    o Fixed type mismatch errors noted by Brian Ripley with gfortran/gcc10 beta. 
      These concerned e.g. 
      
      "Type mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual 
      argument at (2) (REAL(4)/INTEGER(4))" 
      
      ...for zswapy in lapack.f, and
      
      "Rank mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual argument
      at (2) (scalar and rank-1)"
      
      ...for DSCALX. These are warnings generated by gfortran / gcc10, 
      which constitute errors on latest CRAN check.  They are reproduced
      reproduced by installing gcc10 from macports, then making variable 
      definitions explicit so that types match.
      
      E.g., where u(:) (a rank-1 vector) disagrees with wsp(ip) (a scalar),
      make a double precision u1, and say u1 = u(1) and replace u(:).
      
      All tests pass with this change. Changes marked with 2019-11-04_NJM.

OTHER CHANGES
    
    o Fixed type mismatch errors noted by Brian Ripley. These concerned 
      e.g. ZSWAPX taking scalar "u" in one usage, and "wsp(ip)" (an 
      array with a single entry) in another usage. This apparently now 
      creates warnings of e.g. "Warning: Rank mismatch between actual 
      argument at (1) and actual argument at (2) (scalar and rank-1)" 
      in gfortran in GCC10.0 (still in beta). Easy fix with e.g. 
      wspip = REAL(wsp(ip)).

    o The details took some doing to figure out, see

OTHER CHANGES
    
    o In lapack.f, converted ZSWAP to ZSWAPX (for 5-argument inputs)
      and ZSWAPY (for 6-argument inputs), in attempt to fix LTO
      warnings about not matching original declaration, e.g.:
        type of "zswapy" does not match 
        original declaration [-Wlto-type-mismatch]
        call zswapy(k-1,b(k),a(1,k),1,b(1),1)

      complex(kind=8) alpha(ndeg), theta(ndeg), tmpc ->
      complex(kind=8) alpha(2*ndeg), theta(2*ndeg), tmpc
      ...this avoids issues with array overruns when the legacy code is
         checked on gfortran-8 (alpha and theta were size 7, should be 14)
    o Returning CRAN maintainer to Nick Matzke nickmatzke.ncse@gmail.com

CHANGES in rexpokit VERSION 0.26

NEW FEATURES
    
    o None

BUG FIXES

   	o Numerous changes were made to FORTRAN source to solve CRAN check
   	  warnings or installation issues on e.g. Windows machines
   	  (https://win-builder.r-project.org). Typically these were obsolescence
      issues with legacy F77 code. Typically the solution was to convert to
      F90 standard. Summary below.
   	o Fix to a CRAN-identified NOTE: "Packages in Depends field not imported from:
	    'Rcpp'  'SparseM' 'methods'."  Solution: removed methods and SparseM from 
	    Depends, moved Rcpp to Imports in NAMESPACE file
    o Commented out -W flag in Makevars, in order to remove "Non-portable 
      flags in variable 'PKG_FFLAGS'" warning
    o Summary of modernization edits to FORTRAN:
    o complex*16 -> complex(kind=8)
    o CHARACTER*6 -> CHARACTER(LEN=6)
    o double complex -> complex(kind=8)
    o absx = dabs(dreal(zx(i))) -> absx = DABS(REALPART(Zx(i)))
    o absx = dabs(dimag(zx(i))) -> absx = DABS(IMAGPART(Zx(i)))
    o Removed all "statement functions", replaced with basic math in-line
    o Variable declarations for dreal, dimag, dzum, dzumi, dzumr now unnecessary and
      commented out
    o Replaced "Computed GO TO" statements loops re-coded using On-Line 
      Fortran F77 - F90 Converter: https://www.fortran.uk/plusfortonline.php
    o Problems like "Index '2' of dimension 1 of array 'dx' above upper bound of 1"
      solved with changing dx(1) -> dx(n), dy(1) -> dy(n)
    o cabs1 "statement function" replaced with several in-line calculations
    o All example matrix exponentiations checked after FORTRAN edits
    o Generated "init.c" using package_native_routine_registration_skeleton() in 
      order to register native routines. 
      (Following instructions at: 
      https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2017-February/073755.html)
    o init.c content was integrated into pre-existing "wrappers.cpp", adding
      "R_CMethodDef CEntries[]" and "R_init_rexpokit" entries


OTHER CHANGES
    
    o Changed Maintainer email (Nicholas J. Matzke, matzke@berkeley.edu -> 
      Nicholas J. Matzke, nickmatzke.ncse@gmail.com); this is a permanent email.
      All functions changed as well.
    o Added maxent function to avoid BioGeoBEARS dependency on FD
    o Minor edits to documentation
    o Made examples not depend on SparseM
    o updated CITATION file to refer to first publication on BioGeoBEARS/rexpokit: 
      Matzke, Nicholas J. (2013). Probabilistic historical biogeography: 
      new models for founder-event speciation, imperfect detection, and fossils allow 
      improved accuracy and model-testing. Frontiers of Biogeography, 5(4), 242-248.

CHANGES in rexpokit VERSION 0.24.1
