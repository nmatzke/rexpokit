Dear hardworking CRAN maintainers,

I am submitting an update to "rexpokit", rexpokit 0.26.6.9. This is a slight revision of 0.26.6.7 to eliminate fortran compiler issues noted at https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/flang/rexpokit.out and https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/f2008/rexpokit.out

This compiles without errors/warnings/notes on newest R and on r-devel, r-release, and r-old on WinBuilder.

Thanks very much for your time,

Sincerely,
Nick Matzke
