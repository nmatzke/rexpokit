Dear hardworking CRAN maintainers,

I am submitting an update to "rexpokit", rexpokit 0.26.6.10. This is a slight revision of 0.26.6.9 to eliminate fortran compiler issues noted at https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2023/2023-10-10_check_results_rexpokit.html

This compiles without errors/warnings/significant notes on newest R and on r-devel, r-release, and r-old on WinBuilder.

Thanks very much for your time,

Sincerely,
Nick Matzke
