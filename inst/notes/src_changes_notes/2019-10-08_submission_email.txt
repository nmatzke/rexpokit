Dear hardworking CRAN maintainers,

I am submitting an update to "rexpokit", rexpokit 0.26.6.5. This is a slight revision to fix 3 type mismatch or rank mismatch errors noted in FORTRAN code by Brian Ripley when compiling with GCC 10.0. 

This version compiles without errors/warnings/notes with --as-cran on my Mac, and on all three R versions on Winbuilder.

Thanks very much for your time,

Sincerely,
Nick Matzke
